/**
 * The authored seed content for Vortex.
 *
 * This file is the source of truth: everything the dataset gets is written here by hand so the
 * curriculum is coherent top to bottom — a module's lessons genuinely cover that module's topic,
 * and a course's modules genuinely cover that course. Search quality depends on that (AGENTS.md
 * §7), so nothing in here is filler.
 *
 * What is NOT here, because it is derived rather than authored:
 * - lesson `duration` — taken from the real resolved YouTube video (see resolve-videos.mjs)
 * - lesson `videoUrl` and `thumbnail` — the resolved video and its poster frame
 * - module and lesson numbers — derived from array order by the frontend, never stored
 * - course/module duration and lesson counts — derived by GROQ with count() / math::sum()
